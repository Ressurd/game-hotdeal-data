For some it's a short but exciting adventure, some will see it as a place to relax. Yet others will be reminded of their worst nightmare, while for a few, it might come as a revelation.","reviewSummary":"Mixed | 67% | 518 reviews","reviewPercent":67,"reviewCount":518,"developers":"Krealit","publishers":"Krealit","dlcCount":null,"koreanSupport":false,"koreanSubtitle":false,"koreanAudio":false,"englishSupport":true,"englishSubtitle":true,"englishAudio":true,"releaseStatus":"RELEASED","releaseDate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","releaseDateRaw":"22 Sep, 2017"},"latest":{"currency":"USD","price":71,"basePrice":599,"discountPercent":88,"discountEnd":"2026-01-13T14:59:59.000Z","recordedAt":"2026-01-10T05:17:23.579Z"},"history":[],"playerHistory":[],"playerLatest":null,"stats":{"average":71,"allTimeLow":71,"basePriceLow":599,"sixMonthLow":71},"reviewHighlights":[{"text":"A short, original game with a personal, subjective view of the world.
