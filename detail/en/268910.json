Inspired by cartoons of the 1930s, the visuals and audio are painstakingly created with the same techniques of the era, i.e. traditional hand drawn cel animation, watercolor backgrounds, and original jazz recordings.","reviewSummary":"Overwhelmingly Positive | 96% | 69,037 reviews","reviewPercent":96,"reviewCount":69037,"developers":"Studio MDHR Entertainment Inc.","publishers":"Studio MDHR Entertainment Inc.","dlcCount":3,"koreanSupport":true,"koreanSubtitle":true,"koreanAudio":false,"englishSupport":true,"englishSubtitle":true,"englishAudio":false,"releaseStatus":"RELEASED","releaseDate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","releaseDateRaw":"29 Sep, 2017"},"latest":{"currency":"USD","price":1999,"basePrice":1999,"discountPercent":0,"discountEnd":null,"recordedAt":"2026-01-10T01:21:53.977Z"},"history":[],"playerHistory":[],"playerLatest":null,"stats":{"average":1999,"allTimeLow":1999,"basePriceLow":1999,"sixMonthLow":1999},"reviewHighlights":[{"text":"At some point in your life a voice in your head will ask you to 300% this game and get every achievement.
