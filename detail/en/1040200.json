At least they pay a decent salary and all you have to do is clean up after their dirty work, but you know what you’re doing. So clean crime scenes, earn as much money as you can, and get ready for the next mission.","reviewSummary":"Overwhelmingly Positive | 98% | 13,236 reviews","reviewPercent":98,"reviewCount":13236,"developers":"President Studio","publishers":"President Studio, PlayWay S.A.","dlcCount":1,"koreanSupport":true,"koreanSubtitle":true,"koreanAudio":false,"englishSupport":true,"englishSubtitle":true,"englishAudio":true,"releaseStatus":"RELEASED","releaseDate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","releaseDateRaw":"14 Aug, 2024"},"latest":{"currency":"USD","price":2499,"basePrice":2499,"discountPercent":0,"discountEnd":null,"recordedAt":"2026-01-10T01:21:53.977Z"},"history":[],"playerHistory":[],"playerLatest":null,"stats":{"average":2499,"allTimeLow":2499,"basePriceLow":2499,"sixMonthLow":2499},"reviewHighlights":[{"text":"As someone who has now spent 52 hours on this game and buying this as my first game ever, I recommend it to anyone who wants to relax after a long day...","votes":42},{"text":"Sorry for my bad english, This game is awsome like the gamplay, the music, the story.
